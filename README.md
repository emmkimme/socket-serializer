## BufferList Reader Writer
Optimized BufferList reader/writer, purpose is to reduce as much as possible costly buffers creation/copy/clone/split/slice operations.
This BufferList reader allows as well to manage a continuous read in the same list: removing read buffers, add new ones.
Currently, not all Buffer methods are supported, but contributions or suggestions welcome ;-)
We are relying on native Buffer methods and do not overwrite them (except byte read/write, 10 times faster than calling ReadUInt8/WriteUInt8).

## Serializer/Unserializer
Purpose is to serialize Object, Buffer, string, Date, TypedArray, ArrayBuffer, number and boolean with the minimum of transformations in order to improve performance.
We support partial/incremental unserialization that happen with socket.
It is why we do not use classic serializations like BSON or protobuf.

## Socket support
A socket reader/writer classes uses this BufferList to ease the management of the communication.
Buffer remains untouched and go through socket without any changes (copy, merge, split...).
The IpcPacketBuffer is able to read a partial buffer and accumulate incoming buffers until data is completed as socket can not ensure to deliver the same buffer as the one push (see IpcPacketBufferDecoder class).

// Pseudo code for reading data on the fly
```ts
private _bufferListReader: BufferListReader;
private _packet: IpcPacketBufferList;

handleData(data: Buffer): void {
    this._bufferListReader.appendBuffer(data);
    while (this._packet.decodeFromReader(this._bufferListReader)) {
        this.emit('packet-received', packet);
    }
    this._bufferListReader.reduce();
}
```

# Installation

npm install socket-serializer
```

Dependencies

# Parsing/Serialization API
```ts
export class IpcPacketBuffer[List] extends IpcPacketBufferWrap {
    readonly buffer: Buffer;
    readonly buffers: Buffer[];

    isNotValid(): boolean;
    isNotComplete(): boolean;
    isNull(): boolean;
    isUndefined(): boolean;
    isArray(): boolean;
    isObject(): boolean;
    isString(): boolean;
    isBuffer(): boolean;
    isNumber(): boolean;
    isBoolean(): boolean;

 // Generic serialization
    serialize(data: any): void;

 // Generic parsing method
    parse(): any;

 // Specific parsing methods
    parseArrayAt(index: number): any | null;
    parseArraySlice(start?: number, end?: numbers): any | null;

    write(bufferWriter: Writer, data: any): void;
    read(bufferReader: Reader): any;
}
```
## Parsing methods
specific 'parse' methods (parseBoolean, parseNumber...) returns null if it does not mach the type of the stream.

## Serialization methods
Result of serializations is in 'buffer' readonly property.

# Buffer Writer/Reader API
```ts
export interface Writer {
    readonly buffer: Buffer;
    readonly buffers: Buffer[];
    readonly length: number;

    writeByte(data: number): number;
    writeBytes(dataArray: number[]): number;
    writeUInt32(data: number): number;
    writeDouble(data: number): number;
    writeString(data: string, encoding?: BufferEncoding, len?: number): number;
    writeBuffer(data: Buffer, sourceStart?: number, sourceEnd?: number): number;
    write(writer: Writer): number;

}

export interface Reader {
    readonly length: number;
    readonly offset: number;
    noAssert: boolean;

    pushd(): number;    // save current offset
    popd(): number;     // restore offset

    checkEOF(offsetStep?: number): boolean;
    skip(offsetStep?: number): boolean;
    seek(offset: number): boolean;

    readByte(): number;
    readUInt32(): number;
    readDouble(): number;
    readString(encoding?: BufferEncoding, len?: number): string;
    subarray(len?: number): Buffer;
    subarrayList(len?: number): Buffer[];
    slice(len?: number): Buffer;

    reduce(): void; // released read buffers
}
```

## Buffer[Writer/Reader] vs BufferList[Writer/Reader]
BufferWriter/BufferReader works on a single buffer, internal buffer may be changed when concatening another buffer (writeBuffer)
```ts
export interface BufferWriter extends Writer {
}
```
```ts
export interface BufferReader extends Reader {
    constructor(buffer: Buffer, offset?: number);
}
```

BufferListWriter accumulates intermediate buffers in a list. It concatenates them only in a single when calling buffer method. It is faster then recreating a buffer at each modification.
```ts
export interface BufferListWriter extends Writer {
}
```
BufferListReader is able to read value across a set of buffers without need to concat them in a single. You can add new buffer on the fly.
```ts
export interface BufferListReader extends Reader  {
    constructor(buffers?: Buffer[], offset?: number);
    appendBuffer(buffer: Buffer): void;
    reduce(): void; // allow to garbage read buffers, offset is substracted with the len of buffers removed.
}
```

## SocketWriter
When serializing you can write directly to socket using a SocketWriter classes. Each one has a different strategies
* SocketWriter
Write immediately on socket, piece by piece
* DelayedSocketWriter
Write data on socket packet by packet
* BufferedSocketWriter
Write packets when reaching a size

# Sample
```js
const socketHelpers = require('socket-port-helpers');
const socketSerialModule = require('socket-serializer');

let port = 49152;
socketHelpers.findFirstFreePort({portRange: `>=${port}`, log: false, testConnection: true })
.then((port) => {
    let server = new socketSerialModule.IpcPacketNet();
    server.addListener('listening', () => {
        let client = new socketSerialModule.IpcPacketNet();
        client.addListener('packet', (ipcPacketBuffer) => {
            let paramObject = ipcPacketBuffer.parseObject();
            console.log(JSON.stringify(paramObject));
        });
        client.addListener('error', (err) => {
        });
        client.connect(port);
    });
    server.addListener('connection', (socket) => {
        const paramObject = {
            num: 10.2,
            str: "test",
            bool: true,
            array: ["", 10.2, true]
        };
        var ipb = new socketSerialModule.IpcPacketBuffer();
        ipb.serializeObject(paramObject);
        socket.write(ipb.buffer);
    });
    server.addListener('error', (err) => {
    });
    server.listen(port);
});
```
